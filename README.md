### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp course by John Smilga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=421s) - This helped me understand the logic behind an accordian, but it didn't have a smooth transition for opening the answer panel.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - This helped me learn how to add a transition by calculating the answer panel height using "scrollHeight".
